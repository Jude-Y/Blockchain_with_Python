Create a project directory called `wallet` and `cd` into it.

- Clone the `hd-wallet-derive` tool into this folder and install it using the [HD Wallet Derive Installation Guide]

- Create a symlink called `derive` for the `hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php` script. This will clean up the command needed to run the script in our code, as we can call `./derive` instead of `./hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php`: 

  - Make sure you are in the top level project directory - in this case the directory named `wallet`. 
  
  - **Mac Users:** Run the following command: `ln -s hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php derive`. 
  
  - **Windows Users:** Creating symlinks is not supported by default on Windows, only reading them, so Windows users must perform the following steps:

    - Open up Git-Bash as an administrator (right-click on Git-Bash in the start menu).

    - Within `bash`, run the command `export MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict`.
    
    - Run the following command: `ln -s hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php derive`. 

  - Test that you can run the `./derive` script properly, by running the following command within your wallet directory.  

     
    - ./derive --key=xprv9zbB6Xchu2zRkf6jSEnH9vuy7tpBuq2njDRr9efSGBXSYr1QtN8QHRur28QLQvKRqFThCxopdS1UD61a5q6jGyuJPGLDV9XfYHQto72DAE8 --cols=path,address --coin=ZEC --numderive=3 -g

  You will see the following to show that your ./derive works within your wallet directory.
